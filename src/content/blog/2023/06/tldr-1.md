# Projects from the community

Peter Liu made a [Runescape-inspired Minesweeper game](https://petertyliu.github.io/runesweeper/). Did anyone else not know you could right-click to mark squares as bombs? When I first played this I just randomly pressed anywhere in hopes I would get it right.

Elizabeth McCready talks about creating desktop layouts from first principles in her article ["Creating a Simple Desktop Layout in CSS with Just an H1 and One Paragraph"](https://gingerkiwi.blog/blog/2023-06-13-creating-a-simple-desktop-layout-in-css-with-just-h1-and-one-paragraph/)

Philippe Schwyter shared that he's working on [a slack bot for generating images](https://cauli.projectzucchini.com/) like Giphy, but instead using DALL-E.

Marco Campos wrote about "[Web Components: A (Not So) Gentle Introduction](https://madcampos.dev/blog/2023/06/web-components-basics/)".

# What's new in Javascript?

We're getting a new keyword `using`, existing alongside `var`, `let` and `const`, which has the unique property that it lets library developers â€˜do something' when a symbol goes out of scope.

The news is that this will be part of the next Typescript 5.2 release, and sparked some interesting discussions on the [Toronto JS Slack](https://torontojs.slack.com/). Read all about it on: [Total Typescript.](https://www.totaltypescript.com/typescript-5-2-new-keyword-using)

Last week, Svelte [released version 4](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4) of their frontend framework. The release seems mostly incremental with a focus on performance improvements and the Developer experience.
