# Projects from the community

Marcelle Rusu (they/them) has been working on building their own language called Coil. They intend it to make web programming simple, expressive, and powerful. Through building [a web based structural editor](https://coil-editor.netlify.app/) they have shown what Coil is capable of.

# What's new in JavaScript?

[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is becoming [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)! NextAuth is an open-source authentication library that provides a simple and easy-to-use solution for adding authentication and security to web applications. It was created specifically for Next.js, a popular React-based framework, but can also be used with other frameworks and libraries.

Now with the update to v4, it will come with a few breaking changes from the last major version (3.x). This gives developers the ability to test states much more cleanly with the new _status_ option, to have at most two parameters when using the logger API, customization options to built-in pages and much more! [Read more](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/introduction) on the changes/upgrades happening and how to implement Auth.js into your next project!
