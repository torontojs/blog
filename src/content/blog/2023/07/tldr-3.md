Hello everyone!

It is amazing to see the community growing and people getting involved in it. If the number of events and happy faces all around is a sign of success, then weÂ _are_Â successful!

I'd like to take a moment to shout out to the amazing volunteers that make ideas come true. You are the best and we couldn't do it without you! ðŸ¥³

As everyone has bills to pay and, unfortunately, we can't live off dreams alone, we are happy to announce that ourÂ [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/torontojs)Â is up!

Please contribute if you can so we can make this community even better!

All the funds will go towards covering the baseline costs of operation and improving the community events experience.

Now, to the newsâ€¦

# Upcoming events

The upcoming months are full of events to join, here are some highlights:

- HappeningÂ **July 27th,**Â we have theÂ [JS Tech Talk](https://guild.host/events/js-tech-talk-web-fonts-l8sro4)Â in person event with support from Sentry
- **July 28th**:Â [July In-Person Social](https://guild.host/events/july-inperson-social-uobh57)
- **August 19th**:Â [JS Code Club: Online - Group Programming](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/events/fqnzftyfclbzb/)
- **August 30th**:Â [JS Code Club: Online - Group Programming](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/events/ttfwftyfclbnc/)

Please look for our events calendar onÂ [Guild](https://guild.host/torontojs/events)Â andÂ [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/torontojs/events/)Â for other events and more up to date information.

Also, happening in Toronto:

- The React+Native group is hosting a tech talk:Â ["Beyond Markdown: Enhancing Developer Docs with MDX on GitHub Pages"](https://www.meetup.com/toronto-react-native/events/294618947/), onÂ **August 3rd**Â at the Loopio Office. Sounds intriguing!

# Happening in the community

- An interesting, albeit very technical, discussion happened on slack aboutÂ [Fractional Indexing](https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-fractional-indexing/). It is a way of indexing items on a list using floating point numbers where to add or move items we only need to change the index of that item. Find the threadÂ [here](https://torontojs.slack.com/archives/C0664SCTG/p1689692101093849).
- TheÂ [Toronto JS](https://torontojs.com/)Â home page is getting some well-deserved love thanks to Michal Svatos with the help of Jen Chan, Kieran Huggins, and Taz Singh. Now you can see events directly from there!
- A heated debate around UML and the use of diagrams also happened, it has interesting opinions and ideas and is worth checking.Â [Here](https://torontojs.slack.com/archives/C0649AUFL/p1689884290862179)Â is the thread on slack.

# What's new in Javascript?

Let's talk for a second aboutÂ [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API). It is an interesting new technology that allows us toÂ ~~mine crypto on the browser~~Â harness the power of GPUs. WebGPU builds upon the idea of giving developers access to lower-level instructions of the GPU compared toÂ [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

To make a comparison with native, WebGPU would be likeÂ [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan), where WebGL is closer toÂ [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL).

This API makes it easy to do computations on the GPU instead of wrapping it to graphics calls or a shader. That enabled AI and other purely mathematical use cases that benefit from the parallel processing of the GPU to work efficiently. And, for cooler and faster graphics.
