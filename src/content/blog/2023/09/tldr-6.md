I hope we have an amazing and long fall ahead of us, full of amber leaves all over, because as the meme says: winter is coming!

There is [news about a possible whiteout coming this winter](https://www.blogto.com/city/2023/08/winter-weather-forecast/), so let's enjoy all the heat and news before everything freezes up!

## Upcoming events

Happening **tomorrow (September 7th)** [Toast](https://www.trytoast.ca/) will be hosting an Online Hiring Event focused on female and non-binary people. Registration for the event is [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/septembersurge-online-hiring-event-for-women-software-developers-tickets-704965018347?aff=oddtdtcreator).

On **September 16th** at **4 PM EST** we will have the next [Toronto JS Code Club](https://guild.host/events/js-code-club-online-294792793). It will be an online mob programming event, so please bring your projects!

Our next Toronto JS in-person event will happen on **September 27th** (a.k.a. last Wednesday of the month), so stay tuned on the **#events** channel on slack for more information.

**September 29th** also brings us ["Cracking the Silicon Valley North Ceiling: Tackling Challenges Faced by Women and Non-Binary People in Tech"](https://queertech.org/events/56021). An in-person event hosted by [Queertech](https://queertech.org/) for queer woman and non-binary people.

On **November 9 and 10** it will be the next [VueConf Toronto](https://www.vuetoronto.com/).

## Happening in the community

September is bringing us some changes in the organization.

Danny Kim has stepped down from his position as Code Club organizer. Taking his place will be Dale Karp and Marco Campos who will be hosting the events. Thank you, Danny, for gently introducing more people to open-source contributions and I hope we can keep the Code Club vibrant and fun.

Sherry Yang has also stepped down as Community Organizer and the host for online socials. We hope you can bring as much energy to the Calgary tech community as you brought to Toronto.

On more news from the community, here is a shout out to Chensheng Xu for sharing a tool that helps checking the [color contrast for Tailwind colors](https://colour-a11y.vercel.app/) (code [here](https://github.com/samrobbins85/colour-a11y-for-tailwind)).

And a new video from Lazar Nikolov on [CSS Container Queries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHKUFsnABw4) to check out.
