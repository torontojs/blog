We made it all the way to issue 7, and dang is it hard to come up with an introduction for these that keeps it fresh. In fact, it's so difficult that every issue before this one had a mention of the weather! So, without further ado:

So the next 14 days we can expect temperatures up to 20 degrees during the day, with minimal precipitation. It's starting to be time for sweaters and light jackets again. I know that the idea of summer being over and winter is scary, but we're about to enter the prettiest time of the year with the best fashion so it's not all bad!

## Upcoming events

The next in person JS Tech Talk is on **September 27th.** There will be 3 talks:

- **Shruti Vellanki** - Integrating Accessibility into Your Developer Workflow.
- **Nik LeBlanc**, "DORA at DevCycle: Tracking engineering metrics that matter".
- **Rob Jackiewicz**, "Fast iteration cycles, how to get feedback and build the right thing".

So whether you're interested in accessibility, expressing the value your team creates through a discrete set of metrics or simply not being slow, there's something for you here! Last but not least, our very own [**Jen Chan**](https://jenchan.biz/) is sponsoring pizza for this event!

The number of seats for these events is usually limited, so you'll want to [RSVP](https://guild.host/events/js-tech-talk-in-person-yqdf9q) soon to ensure you have a spot!

## Updates from the last TJS Code Club

[Last Saturday](https://guild.host/events/js-code-club-online-294792793) there was another Code Club! There were 5 separate streams on Discord, and here's some of the accomplishments from that day:

- [Charles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesbridgersiv/) brought his comic book web app for feedback. We noticed that there were some comics with covers containing explicit content. So we worked on a solution to filter comics by rating.
- [Marco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madcampos/) stayed in the main room exploring a simple reverse proxy with [Hono](https://hono.dev/). It went pretty fast and took the first half of the event. On the later half there were general discussions and a showcase of other projects that Marco has worked on.
- [Aun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aun--raza/) worked on his [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) note taking app to solve a problem with data persistency.
- [Elizabeth](https://gingerkiwi.blog/) was having issues loading a font file on her react project with [chakra.js](https://chakra-ui.com/). We figured out how to load custom fonts with Chakra.js and that that the font file needed to be in the¬†`/public`¬†directory.
- [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjacksondev/) had a TDD session in one room to discuss how to better integrate tests in a code base.

## Terminal Tip

If you're on a recent mac, you're probably already using ZSH instead of the previous default Bash. ZSH has a lot of nice features that make it easier to use, but they're not always easy to find. My tip today is to take a look at [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) Installing it will instantly yassify your command prompt and for example show you your current git branch, but it also comes with dozens of plugins that are easily turned on.

Works on Mac, Linux, FreeBSD, GNU/Herd, AIX, OpenSolaris or Windows (with WSL).

Thanks for reading Toronto JS TL;DR!
