## Industry News

New changes have landed for Remix v2 and Next.js 13.5!!!

First off! What is [Remix](https://remix.run/)? Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface. It is built on the Web Fetch API (instead of Node), that allows the code to be run anywhere.

With adjustments to the minimum version support for Remix v2, it now officially requires React 18 as well as Node 18 or later to use. There has been added changes with removals of future flags from the remix.config.js file, as well as lots of changes/API removals that had a lot of deprecation warnings in Remix v1. For all the changes with v2, they can be viewed [here](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%402.0.0)!

Now Next.js 13.5. Developers have been complaining about the slowness of the Next.js dev server lately, so these changes with 13.5 will increase that! 22% faster startup, 29% faster HMR (fast refresh), 40% less memory usage, optimized package imports and **over 438 bugs patched! wow!** Read about all the changes with Next.js [here](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-5)!
