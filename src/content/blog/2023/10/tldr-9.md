Hey folks, let's talk security because the season is spooky!

Starting with the basics: [have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a website where you can check if your email has shown up in data breaches.

If you want a video explanation on the site and why it is important, here it is:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OnpQNLrzoW0" width="300" height="400" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" credentialless="true" referrerPolicy="no-referrer" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" allow="accelerometer 'none'; ambient-light-sensor 'none'; autoplay 'none'; battery 'none'; browsing-topics 'none'; camera 'none'; display-capture 'none'; domain-agent 'none'; document-domain 'none'; encrypted-media 'none'; execution-while-not-rendered 'none'; execution-while-out-of-viewport ''; gamepad 'none'; geolocation 'none'; gyroscope 'none'; hid 'none'; identity-credentials-get 'none'; idle-detection 'none'; local-fonts 'none'; magnetometer 'none'; microphone 'none'; midi 'none'; otp-credentials 'none'; payment 'none'; picture-in-picture 'none'; publickey-credentials-create 'none'; publickey-credentials-get 'none'; screen-wake-lock 'none'; serial 'none'; speaker-selection 'none'; usb 'none'; window-management 'none'; xr-spatial-tracking 'none'", csp="sandbox allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

If you want to get geeky and dive into the rabbit hole on the breach that started everything and the logic behind it on a funny way, this XKCD comic is for you ([here is the explained page](https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1286:_Encryptic), because I'm not so smart to understand the pun without someone explaining it to me):

Now to the next point: use a password manager, but don't pick anyone as they are [also susceptible to attacks and breaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHnF66L-Os).

If you want to understand how a password manager works, here is a video explaining that:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w68BBPDAWr8" width="300" height="400" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" credentialless="true" referrerPolicy="no-referrer" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" allow="accelerometer 'none'; ambient-light-sensor 'none'; autoplay 'none'; battery 'none'; browsing-topics 'none'; camera 'none'; display-capture 'none'; domain-agent 'none'; document-domain 'none'; encrypted-media 'none'; execution-while-not-rendered 'none'; execution-while-out-of-viewport ''; gamepad 'none'; geolocation 'none'; gyroscope 'none'; hid 'none'; identity-credentials-get 'none'; idle-detection 'none'; local-fonts 'none'; magnetometer 'none'; microphone 'none'; midi 'none'; otp-credentials 'none'; payment 'none'; picture-in-picture 'none'; publickey-credentials-create 'none'; publickey-credentials-get 'none'; screen-wake-lock 'none'; serial 'none'; speaker-selection 'none'; usb 'none'; window-management 'none'; xr-spatial-tracking 'none'", csp="sandbox allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

Now for the last bit of news on security: [Google is making passkeys the default for new accounts](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/).

And "what are passkeys" you might ask, in short, they are a more secure way to confirm identity than passwords, as they rely on public key cryptography.

Here are some links about passkeys:

Now for something completely different…

## Community Showcase

A shout to Daniel Stoianov's mom who is making some cute "pair programming buddies".

She lives in Ukraine and since February 2022, she has been doing volunteer work daily related to supporting veterans. She also volunteers in a kitchen that prepares food for the army. Before this, she made toys that were sold at charity auctions. She gifts many of these toys to soldiers, who use them as talismans in the trenches.
