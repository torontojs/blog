## Next.js vs Remix

In the category of bulky backend frameworks that solve problems React introduced, new problems are afoot.

Kent C. Dodds, contributor to theÂ [Remix](https://remix.run/)Â framework wrote an article titledÂ ["Why I Won't Use Next.js"](https://www.epicweb.dev/why-i-wont-use-nextjs), which, if you're a user of eitherÂ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)Â or React is worth reading. In my opinion it reflects shifting opinion against Next and React pretty well, including the growing influence of Vercel, a company that's paid its way into the Frontend developer's mindshare.

Is Next.js or React going away? Of course not! But it's a glimpse in the shifting mindset highly popular technology stacks go through as they first win everyone's hearts, but eventually gain a growing resentment which makes room for new upstarts that don't have all their predecessor's baggage. And so the wheel turns.
