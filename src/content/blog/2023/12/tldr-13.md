_"I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by." ― Douglas Adams_

Well, we've reached the last issue of TL;DR of the year, and the _first_ that's a week late! Oops! But we made it to 13 issues. Not bad! Perhaps we can double it next year.

Also, wow… what a wild year for our industry.

After years of growth, we've had the highest layoffs since the dotcom bubble in 2001. Many of which due to macro-economic trends, but of course also many companies taking advantage the downturn to get rid of people at a time everyone else does.

Many of us have felt the effects, either by being laid off and trying to find land the next gig or in our network. I wasn't spared myself! Certainly a humbling experience.

So here's hoping for a better year! We're not out of the woods yet.

## Upcoming events

We have one last [JS Code Club: Online](https://guild.host/events/js-code-club-online-gdr9gl) this year, happening this Saturday, the 23rd. Do you have a fun holiday project? This might be a great place to kick it off.

In the next year our first event will be a new [Code Buddy](https://guild.host/events/torontojs-code-buddy-kq8vnp) event on Discord. Code Buddy is like a book club, but instead of books the group will study tutorials and courses together. This is happening January 16th. Read all about it on [Guild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera#Origins).

## The year in JS - Marco Campos

2023 went so fast, it seems like January 1st was yesterday! Lots of things happened on the web recently, so here are some reviews and highlights:

Let's start with this very thorough review from Kevin Powell on the new things happening in CSS in 2023:

Safari (and in turn every browser on iOS) are getting even better support for PWAs, making them [almost usable in iOS](https://firt.dev/notes/pwa-ios/).

Here is a overview from WWDC 2023: [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10120](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10120)

On JS land, here is another video with a bit of irony on the changes in Javascript this year:

On a more serious note, for all of you working with node and typescript: update to the latest LTS (version 20), set `type: module` on your `package.json`, and set `module: nodenext` and `target: es2022` on your `tsconfig.json`.

This will ensure you will have native ES modules running on node with the least amount of compilation from typescript. It will save you a lot of headaches with edge cases and quirks on module resolution and async code… ask me how I know! 🙃

## Happy holidays!

Hope you all get the rest you deserve and an excellent 2024, from Drey, Marco & Evert and all of the Toronto JS volunteer team!
