Today is a double post day! Woo hoo! This is a short one though.

## Calendar you say?

The idea is that we have a set calendar from the start of the year so that gives people more time to organize for upcoming events.

## What 2025 have in store for us?

We would like to do two things:
- Have better cadence on the stream of events, so they are evenly spread out through the year.
- Have some themed events and months.
## Toronto JS needs you!

We are planning the events calendar for 2025 and want help from you!

If you are interested in helping organize the calendar for 2025 and then help us keep that happening, please contact organizers@torontojs.com.
