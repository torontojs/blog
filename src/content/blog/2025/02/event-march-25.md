Hello everyone, we are thrilled to announce an upcoming event on **March 25th, 2025**, organized by Aman and Mariana and hosted at [Super.com](https://super.com).

## The event ‚ú®

In this hands-on free workshop, we‚Äôll explore the power of dotLottie, the lightweight, flexible animation format that enhances web performance and interactivity. You'll learn how to integrate dotLottie animations seamlessly into your JavaScript projects and take them beyond static visuals by adding real-time user interactions using event-driven techniques.

By the end of this workshop, you‚Äôll be able to:
- Load and control dotLottie animations dynamically in JavaScript
- Trigger animations based on user inputs (scroll, hover, clicks, and more)
- Optimize animations for smooth performance and responsiveness
- Use dotLottie in real-world applications (websites, apps, UI elements)

Whether you're a developer, designer, or UI/UX enthusiast, this session will equip you with practical skills to elevate your animations and create engaging web experiences with ease.
