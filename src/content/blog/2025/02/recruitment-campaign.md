Hey Folks!

## Off to a good start

We hope you had a fantastic holiday and a happy new year from the TorontoJS organization team.

In 2025, we successfully launched a blog platform developed by community members, and the experience was so inspiring that we decided to take it a step further.

## Ambitious new project

We began working on the TorontoJS Community Hub (VMS), an open-source design project aimed at solving challenges like volunteer onboarding and providing frictionless, future-proof data for the community to create new solutions‚Äîor just fun, quirky projects!

This initiative offers a fantastic opportunity for developers, designers, and other experts to contribute to a large open-source project benefiting a vibrant community.

## Thank you sponsors and community partners!

We‚Äôd like to thank our volunteers, project owners/leads and organizers for making these events / projects possible and lets not forget our community partners who help keep the lights on:

### üêâ [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io) & üì¶ [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io)
A big shout-out to **[DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io)** and **[Sanity](https://www.sanity.io)** for their generous sponsorship. Your partnership helps us create an exceptional experience.

### üöÄ [Super.com](https://www.super.com)
Special thanks to **[Super.com](https://www.super.com)** for providing a venue!

We deeply appreciate the commitment and support of all our sponsors.

Without them our events wouldn‚Äôt be possible so a million thanks for that!

## Help us make 2025 an even bigger success!

As we kick off the new year, perhaps you‚Äôve been to one of our events and you‚Äôve really enjoyed them and would like to contribute in some way?

We are looking to fulfill these particular roles:

Blog team :: Producer (marco@torontojs.com @dann@torontojs.com)
Our community produces an incredible amount of great content: projects in our #show-n-tell channel, helpful and deep responses to questions, videos, games, posts, and more. Your job is to identify things that would make great blog posts, and work with people to make those posts happen! This might be as simple as getting permission to cross post existing work, to helping someone write their very first post about their cool new project, to taking an interesting slack thread and turning it into an interesting blog post.

Web team :: Historian (dann@torontojs.com)
We‚Äôve run literally hundreds of events over the last decade, and have almost no content about that on our site. This is literally a crying shame. We should change that! This position will work with the web team to figure out how to incorporate all of our past event data from event scheduling sites, and bring that onto our own site. There‚Äôs probably some grunt work involved, like scraping meetup.com for our historic data, but there‚Äôs opportunity for creative work as well, like figuring out a good archive format for events, and extending the event archive with projects like a visual timeline, a tool for importing photos, and so on.

TorontoJS Social :: Co-organizer (marco@torontojs.com)
Want to help run a super fun social event? The JS Social is one of our most popular events, and we‚Äôre looking for an enthusiastic co-organizer to help plan and host fun times for everyone!

TechTalk Online :: Co-organizer (ken@torontojs.com)
You‚Äôd like to organize an annual, one off or regular recurring online event? Pitch us your idea.

Promo :: Social Media Manager (ken@torontojs.com)
You are a visibility champion? You love giving credits to those who give back to the community?
Help with managing our social accounts(Linkedin, Meetup.com, Guild.io, Instagram, Youtube & Twitter) and or create content shedding light on our community stars!

## Interested? Something else?

Maybe you have something to offer that isn‚Äôt in that list? Want to organize an event, or start a new project, a newsletter? Something else we didn‚Äôt cover? Reach out to us at organizers@torontojs.com . No idea is too big or too small!

We look forward to hearing from you and making 2025 an unforgettable year building the community together!
