Hello folks, PubScript is back for the summer season of 2025, so get your sunglasses and short sleeve shirts ready because you won't want to miss the good times!

## Pub what?

PubScript is our social event at a local pub, and a terrible joke with "JavaScript" and "pub".

The event is a social time for us to talk to people, network, talk about tech or other non tech related things.

Everyone is welcome to join us, both drinkers and non drinkers alike.

## The schedule

The social events will run the second Friday of each month, between June and September, from 7 pm to 10 pm.

The dates and links for the events are:

### Getting there

#### Transit

- TTC: Right near Queen TTC Station, and on the Yonge bus line
- GO Transit: Two stops north of Union Station on the Yonge subway line

#### Cycling

- Close to the Richmond and Adelaide east/west cycle tracks
- There's Bike Share Toronto docking stations nearby. The closest is on Richmond Street at Yonge.

#### Driving

- Check with Green P for public parking lots. With the Firkin on Yonge being in the heart of downtown Toronto there's parking, but it's much easier to take transit.

## Event Accessibility

### Venue

The Firkin is wheelchair accessible with level access, elevator to the second floor and to the washrooms in the basement. Washrooms are accessible with accessible stalls in each gendered washroom. The Firkin hosts events by A11yTO, so the staff handles disability accommodation requests professionally and respectfully.

### Transit

The closest accessible station is usually Queen Station, but due to water damage the northbound platform station is not accessible until July, 2024. If you are arriving from Union or if you are going home north bound you will need an alternate route.

The closest accessible TTC routes are:

1. Yonge bus north to Dundas Station or Wellesley Station
2. St. Andrew Station, then the King Street streetcar east to Yonge Street. Walk or roll north three blocks. The streetcar tracks on the east side of Queen are filled in so it's an easy wheel over them (no front casters getting stuck)!
3. Union, then the Bay bus north. Catch the bus at the SE corner of Bay and Front Streets. Get off at Queen and Bay. Walk or roll east one block. (Note there is construction so it's quite a tight sidewalk with bumps.)

WheelTrans can drop off on Yonge. The Firkin entrance is right near the stairway TTC entrance on the sidewalk.

_Please contact the organizers if you have any accessibility questions or concerns._

## What about a picnic or a day at the beach?

If you are interested in organizing other events, even if it is for a small group, we are more than happy to help with that!

Please reach out on slack in the channel #team-eventsmaking and we can help you sort the event out.
